 * the request body.
 * @param NextApiResponse - NextApiResponse is a type definition for the response object in Next.js API
 * routes. It provides a set of methods and properties that can be used to send a response back to the
 * client, such as setting the status code, headers, and sending JSON data.

body (dateOrdered, orderNumber, orderDetails, trackingInfo, shippingCost, requestID, and adminID)
